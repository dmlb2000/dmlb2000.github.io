I struggle with this topic because I don't like talking about myself.

There are many facets to me. So let me just make a list and I'll start
trying to go more in depth into those...

 * The achievements and titles I've earned over the years. 
 * How I approach life and coding software.
 * What I'm passionate about.

# Achievements and Titles

 * Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2006) from Washington
   State University.
 * Masters of Computer Science (2012) from Washington State
   University.

# Approach to Life and Coding

This topic encroaches on personal philosophy and religion. As this
is a GitHub about me page I'll try and focus on software (as
opposed to political, world view, etc).

I like to think about truth in the same way that
[Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/771176428880617472?lang=en)
does. Applying that philosophy to software can be done, and I'll
attempt to write the conversion in [this post](/2020-01-24-philosophy)

I always have a purpose in mind, I'm very driven by making a
difference. I want the work I do to matter, not to make a million
dollars but impact beyond just money.
