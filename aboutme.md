I struggle with this topic because I don't like talking about myself.

There are two aspects to this topic. First, is the achievements and

Every piece of software is an expression of a thought. Like all
thoughts some are right and lots are wrong. Only when we have others
use and review our software do we begin to change a thought into an
objective truth.
