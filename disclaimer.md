All views expressed on this site are my own and do not represent the
opinions of any entity with which I have been, am now, or will be
affiliated.

If something on my site offends you, the following is a sampling of
entities you should **NOT** blame.

 * My wife
 * My kids
 * My employer
 * My church
 * My Twitter followers
 * GitHub
 * My immediate family
 * My government
 * My employer
 * The Republicans
 * The Democrats
 * Batman

The following list is a complete, unabridged, 100%, undeniably
exhaustive record of entities that you **SHOULD** blame.

 * Me

All of that being said. I hope that, given the theme of my site and
my personal philosophy, we can move beyond blame. If you disagree
with something, I would welcome a discussion. It would be my privilege
to learn from what you have to teach me.
